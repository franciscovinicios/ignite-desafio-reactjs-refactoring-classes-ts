## Challenge description

<p>
  In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an already functional application where its main objective is to perform two migration processes: from Javascript to
 Typescript and from Class Components to Function Components.

Next we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done 🚀
</p>

## Tech Stack

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

-   **React**
